This project is primarily an experiment to see what i can do with a breakdown of the Quran into word tokens: http://corpus.quran.com/.

The Quran Corpus document is processed using Python and the result is a JSON document suitable for import in a NodeJS application.

Such an application can be found in the quran-words-site folder.  To get that running, you'll first need to install Node, which you can do very simply from the http://nodejs.org/ site.

Then, from the quran-words-site folder, you'll need to run  "npm install"  to install of the dependencies.

Once that's finished, you should be able to run  "node web.js"  to run the server.  It will run on port 5000 by default.

To test this, you can open your browser to http://localhost:5000/api/words, and you should get a list of the top 10 "words" by count in the Quran.  The response is in JSON, so you might want to get a JSON viewer plugin for your browser.
